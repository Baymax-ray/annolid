## Installation

* Clone the code repo and change into the directory
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/healthonrails/annolid.git
cd annolid 

# install the package
pip install -e .
```
Note: if you got this error: 
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement decord>=0.4.0
```
, please try to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or you can install it in conda `conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg`.

## Launch annolid user interface based on labelme
```bash
source activate your_env_name
annolid
#or you can provide a label.txt file as follows.
annolid --labels=/path/to/labels_custom.txt 

```

## How to label animals and behaviors? 
### Polygons & keypoints(e.g. Vole_1, nose, tail_base, rearingâ€¦...)

* To train models for tracking animals and assigning IDs, please 
label each instance with a unique name or ID (e.g. vole_1, mouse_2, or frog_femal_01).

* For instances without needing to assign IDs across different frames, please 
label instances with a generic name or ID (e.g vole, mouse, or frog). 

* For encoding behaviors, please name the ploygon with the behavior name (e.g. rearing, object_investigation, or grooming)

* For body parts, please use keypoint with names like nose, tail_base, or left_ear.
